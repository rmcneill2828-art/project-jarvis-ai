# 1. Purpose

This artefact records the current programme status for Project JARVIS AI.

It exists to provide a concise engineering context snapshot at the start of future engineering sessions.

PST-0001 supports faster session start-up by preserving the current programme state without requiring long conversation history to be reloaded.

Repository evidence remains authoritative over conversational memory.

---

# 2. Scope

This artefact records:

- current programme phase;
- current engineering workflow;
- current capability roadmap;
- completed engineering milestones;
- active and next planned engineering work;
- current repository and product baselines;
- outstanding observations;
- session start guidance.

This artefact does not record detailed engineering decisions. Detailed decisions remain in controlled artefacts, accepted baselines, registers, standards, reviews and session reports.

# 3. Current Programme State

| Item | Current State |
|------|---------------|
| Project | Project JARVIS AI |
| Engineering System | AI Engineering Management System (AIEMS) |
| Repository | project-jarvis-ai |
| Primary Branch | main |
| Current Mode | [[ESR-0016_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0016]] remains the latest **closed** session. [[ESR-0017_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0017]] is open in progress: WP1-WP4 complete and independently reviewed, WP6/WP7 complete (RBL-0012 accepted), WP8/WP9 pending Programme Sponsor scope definition before the session closes. |
| Current Repository Baseline | [[RBL-0012_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0012]] accepted mid-session (WP7), superseding RBL-0011 - ESR-0017's WP1-WP4 changes judged comparable in weight to ESR-0015's milestone. This baseline acceptance stands; it is not contingent on WP8/WP9. |
| Current Product Capability Baseline | [[PCB-0001_PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_BASELINE|PCB-0001]] accepted as current operational JARVIS product baseline - unchanged so far; the UXP remains a disconnected static shell pending EBG-0050. |
| Repository Product Capability Assessment | [[RPCA-0001_REPOSITORY_PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT|RPCA-0001]] completed and accepted. |
| Current Phase | ESR-0017 in progress: WP1-WP4 (UXP-backend architecture decision, Guardian&harr;Sentinel connection, Gemini provider adapter, five-session roadmap) complete, reviewed and baselined (RBL-0012). WP8 and WP9 outstanding. |
| Current Workflow | AIEMS Engineering Workflow v3 with Engineering Ecosystem Synchronisation working practice, operating under the EE-0001 Lead/Reviewer trial (ESR-0017 Claude leads, currently still open; ESR-0018 - ChatGPT leads next per the frozen rotation - has not yet begun). |
| Current Engineering Objective | ESR-0017 remains open pending WP8/WP9 scope definition from the Programme Sponsor. No ESR-0018 objective is created by this status update. |

---

# 4. Current Engineering Workflow

The current approved workflow remains AIEMS Engineering Workflow v3 with clarified authority, validation, verification and acceptance lifecycle.

Workflow sequence:

1. Engineering Planning
2. Programme Sponsor Approval
3. Implementation
4. Programme Sponsor Validation
5. Commit and Push
6. Independent Repository Verification
7. Programme Sponsor Baseline Acceptance
8. Phase Closure

ESR-0007 and ESR-0008 added the following accepted working practices pending future standards review:

| Working Practice | Status | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| Repository-First Engineering Protocol (RFEP) | Accepted ESR-0007 working practice | Repository evidence is the primary engineering memory. |
| Repository-First Decision Protocol (RFDP) | Accepted ESR-0007 working practice | Engineering decisions are grounded in controlled artefacts and executable evidence. |
| Continuous Repository Synchronisation | Accepted ESR-0007 working practice | Session, status, register and baseline artefacts are synchronised at closure. |
| Engineering Ecosystem Synchronisation | Accepted ESR-0008 working practice | GitHub, AIEMS, OSE, Obsidian, controlled artefacts, registers, previous ESRs and summaries are considered during synchronisation. |

These practices are not formal AIEMS standards unless separately reviewed and standardised through future approved work.

# 4A. Current Engineering Focus

[[ESR-0017_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0017]] remains **Open**. This is the third Engineering Session run under the EE-0001 Lead/Reviewer trial, and the designated **Cold Start Validation Session** (EE-0001 Section 3.4): Claude as Engineering Lead, ChatGPT as Independent Reviewer, Programme Sponsor gating every step, the session begun in a fresh conversation using only README.md, PST-0001, the Current ESR and referenced artefacts - the first empirical proof in the trial that a fresh AI Lead can onboard from repository documentation alone (verified **&check;**).

ESR-0017 has so far delivered four Work Packages, each independently reviewed: WP1 decided the UXP-to-backend integration architecture ([[ADR-0019_UXP_BACKEND_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE|ADR-0019]] - Tauri sidecar-managed Python process, duplex stdio JSON-RPC); WP2 connected `GuardianRuntime` through Sentinel for the first time (`converse()`, proven against real `SentinelTrustGateway`/`ProviderOrchestrator` components); WP3 added a second external Sentinel provider adapter (`GeminiProvider`, mirroring `OpenAIProvider`); WP4 produced a five-session backlog progression roadmap (ESR-0017 through ESR-0021). All four WPs were reviewed by the Engineering Reviewer: 0 Blocking, 0 Major findings across all four, 10 Minor/Observation-severity findings, all accepted. A mid-session process deviation (WP1-WP3 implemented before any Reviewer pause) was caught and corrected by the Programme Sponsor; a validator defect (`check_stale_status_references` flagging Open sessions as stale) and a `bump_version.py` self-referential-target defect were both found and fixed during the session, each with regression tests.

WP6 Independent Repository Verification (Pass) and WP7 Repository Baseline Acceptance both completed mid-session: [[RBL-0012_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0012]] was accepted as the current repository baseline, superseding RBL-0011, judged comparable in weight to ESR-0015's milestone. **This baseline acceptance stands regardless of further Work Packages** - the Programme Sponsor has indicated WP8 and WP9 will follow within ESR-0017 before the session closes; their scope is not yet defined.

The EE-0001 trial scorecard for ESR-0017 (see [[EE-0001_INDEPENDENT_AI_PEER_REVIEW_TRIAL|EE-0001]] Section 9) records the Lead's draft self-assessment, reviewed and refined by the Engineering Reviewer, who substantially agreed and contributed four refinements plus two new joint recommendations for future EE-0001/PBK-0001 changes (EBG-0052, EBG-0053) - neither adopted, both logged as candidates. This scorecard reflects WP1-WP4 only and may require a further entry once WP8/WP9 are known. This is recorded as evidence for the EE-0001 trial, not as a conclusion about adopting or rejecting the Lead/Reviewer rotation - that decision remains reserved for ESR-0018 closure per EE-0001 Section 7.

PST-0001 records the ESR-0017 in-progress state. It does not close ESR-0017, create ESR-0018 as an active session, or approve implementation outside separately authorised engineering work.

# 5. Current Capability Roadmap

| Capability | Status | Maturity | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Repository Architecture | Complete | Complete | Repository structure, package layout and governance separation are established. |
| Governance Framework | In Progress | High | Core AIEMS governance artefacts support controlled product delivery and are ready to be tested through implementation-led engineering. |
| Engineering Standards | In Progress | High | Approved standards remain in place; RFEP, RFDP and Continuous Repository Synchronisation are working practices pending any future standards review. |
| JARVIS Product Architecture | Complete | High | [[JARVIS_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE|JARVIS Product Architecture]] remains the product architecture authority. |
| JARVIS Platform Architecture | Draft | High | [[ESR-0011_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0011]] validated JARVIS Platform, Sentinel, Platform Services, UXP, Provider Architecture, Agent Framework and GIA positioning for implementation readiness. |
| Sentinel AI Execution and Security Platform | Implemented | High | [[ADR-0018_SENTINEL_AI_EXECUTION_SECURITY_PLATFORM|ADR-0018]] positions Sentinel as the AI Execution and Security Platform; Sentinel Core, provider abstraction, local/OpenAI/Gemini providers, health-aware provider orchestration with failover, audit, policy and a trust-tier policy model are implemented under `sentinel/` with 166 passing tests. Gemini is unwired by default and not yet live-tested (EBG-0051). |
| Guardian Cognitive Architecture | Draft | High | [[AAM-0001_GUARDIAN_IDENTITY_AND_COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE|AAM-0001]] records Guardian identity and cognitive architecture; ESR-0013 established a bounded runtime foundation without implementing full Guardian cognition. |
| Guardian Experience Architecture | Approved Baseline | High | [[UAM-0001_GUARDIAN_EXPERIENCE_ARCHITECTURE_V1|UAM-0001]] records Guardian Experience Architecture v1.0; [[ESR-0011_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0011]] confirms Guardian Orb should consume real observable state. |
| Engineering Ecosystem Architecture | Implementation Validated | High | [[ADR-0013_ENGINEERING_ECOSYSTEM_SYNCHRONISATION|ADR-0013]] records Obsidian/OSE and Engineering Ecosystem Synchronisation; ESR-0012 validated AIEMS operationally through implementation. |
| Guardian Instrumentation Agent | Proof of Concept Complete | Early | [[ESR-0012_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0012]] completed GIA-BOOT as a Proof of Concept; further GIA implementation is deferred. |
| User Experience Platform | Established, Disconnected | Foundation | [[ADR-0007_USER_EXPERIENCE_PLATFORM_SELECTION|ADR-0007]] records Tauri + React as the UXP direction; ESR-0009 adopted it as the UXP implementation baseline. [[ADR-0019_UXP_BACKEND_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE|ADR-0019]] (ESR-0017) decided how it should reach the backend (Tauri sidecar, duplex stdio JSON-RPC) - not yet implemented (EBG-0050). The running shell still renders `src/platformStatus.js`'s hardcoded state with a disabled chat input. |
| JARVIS Product Capability Baseline | Accepted | Foundation | [[PCB-0001_PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_BASELINE|PCB-0001]] records the accepted operational product baseline. |
| JARVIS Capability Maturity | Maintained | Early | [[JARVIS_CAPABILITY_READINESS_MATRIX|JARVIS Capability Readiness Matrix]] remains the authoritative maturity model. |
| JARVIS Development | In Progress | Early | Guardian Desktop Platform Shell, Guardian Experience v1.0, GIA-BOOT Proof of Concept, Guardian Runtime Foundation and Guardian&harr;Sentinel connection (ESR-0017) exist; none are reachable through the running UXP yet - unimplemented runtime capabilities and the UXP bridge remain outside the accepted operational product baseline. |
| Runtime Chat Archive | Complete | Foundation | Prototype chat exports are archived under `logs/chats/`; EBG-0039 is completed in [[EBR-0001_ENGINEERING_BACKLOG_REGISTER|EBR-0001]]. |

# 10. Outstanding Observations

The following observations remain open for future engineering consideration:

- [[RBL-0011_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0011]] is retained as the current repository baseline, superseding [[RBL-0010_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0010]] since ESR-0015 and retained through ESR-0016, pending any future controlled baseline creation.
- [[ESR-0013_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0013]] established the Guardian Platform Foundation through runtime boundary, lifecycle integration, status snapshot and observability work.
- [[ESR-0014_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0014]] is closed. [[ADR-0018_SENTINEL_AI_EXECUTION_SECURITY_PLATFORM|ADR-0018]] positions Sentinel as the AI Execution and Security Platform. Sentinel Core, provider abstraction, local provider, provider configuration, provider orchestration, audit, policy and (since ESR-0016) a trust-tier policy model are implemented under `sentinel/` with 144 passing tests.
- [[ESR-0014A_POST_CLOSURE_ENGINEERING_ADDENDUM|ESR-0014A]] is closed. [[GDE-0001_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP|GDE-0001]] introduces knowledge tiering for Engineering Session initialisation.
- Guardian Runtime is not yet connected through Sentinel - candidate ESR-0017 focus per [[ESR-0016_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0016]] Section 16.
- PEM-001 provider scoring is complete (ESR-0015): Primary OpenAI (implemented), Secondary Gemini, reasoning/coding comparison Anthropic, Gateway OpenRouter, local fallback Ollama - none of these four beyond OpenAI are implemented yet, candidate ESR-0017 focus.
- [[ESR-0015_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0015]] and [[ESR-0016_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0016]] are both closed. The EE-0001 Lead/Reviewer trial has run two of its four sessions (Claude led ESR-0015, ChatGPT led ESR-0016); Sponsor arbitration required was assessed Low then High respectively, by both Lead and Reviewer independently each time. The adopt/reject decision remains reserved for ESR-0018 closure per EE-0001 Section 7.
- GIA-BOOT is accepted as a Proof of Concept.
- Further GIA implementation is deferred.
- AIEMS Engineering Agent is adopted to support the Engineering Reviewer role.
- Remaining Engineering Agent validation is deferred.
- Future EAC implementation is deferred.
- Guardian Memory remains deferred.
- Conversation Engine expansion remains deferred.
- Guardian Developer Console remains deferred.
- Guardian Orb implementation remains deferred until real observable platform state is ready for presentation-layer consumption.
- Automation remains deferred.
- Persistent storage remains deferred.
- GDP-0001 implementation remains deferred.
- Repository First is reinforced by ESR-0012 operational evidence.
- Look Inward Before Looking Outward is identified as an engineering principle derived from operational evidence, but is not introduced as a new AIEMS standard by this status update.
- The Engineering Reviewer and Guardian operating environments remain separated.
- Guardian Orb implementation remains deferred until real observable platform state exists.
- Resilience Before Disablement / local fallback remains accepted as an engineering direction pending implementation evidence.
- External AI providers, persistent memory, voice, vision and internet-backed assistance remain outside the accepted operational product baseline.
- RFEP, RFDP, Continuous Repository Synchronisation and Engineering Ecosystem Synchronisation may be considered in a future formal AIEMS standards review.
- Obsidian is recognised as the human-facing Engineering Knowledge Workspace for OSE while GitHub remains the source of truth.

1. Established Sentinel as a standalone top-level package.
2. Implemented Sentinel Core trust boundary primitives.
3. Implemented provider abstraction, provider registry and capability resolution.
4. Implemented the local deterministic provider.
5. Implemented provider configuration, credential references and retry policies.
6. Implemented the provider orchestrator foundation with health states, health-aware capability routing, automatic failover and execution history.
7. Added dedicated test suites for Sentinel Core, providers, provider configuration and provider orchestration, taking coverage from 58 to 100 passing tests.
8. Created [[PEM-001_AI_PROVIDER_EVALUATION_MATRIX|PEM-001]] to support evidence-based AI provider ecosystem selection.
9. Approved [[ADR-0018_SENTINEL_AI_EXECUTION_SECURITY_PLATFORM|ADR-0018]], positioning Sentinel as the AI Execution and Security Platform for AIEMS.
10. Created [[ESR-0014_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0014]] as the formal session closure report.
11. Retained [[RBL-0010_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0010]] as the current accepted repository baseline.

---

# 19. ESR-0014A Outcomes

1. Identified, through an AI-followability review of AIEMS, that mandatory Engineering Session initialisation reading grows without bound as sessions accumulate.
2. Created [[GDE-0001_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP|GDE-0001]], defining a tiered knowledge structure (Current State, Architecture, Active Standards, Current ESR, Historical Archive).
3. Amended [[PBK-0001_AI_ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK|PBK-0001]] Session Initialisation and WP0A guidance to reference GDE-0001 rather than enumerating the full AIEMS History and Full Chat archive.
4. Amended [[COC-0001_HUMAN_AI_COLLABORATION_CONTEXT|COC-0001]] and README.md for consistency with GDE-0001.
5. Registered GDE-0001, ESR-0014A and ESR-0014 itself in [[REG-0001_CONTROLLED_ARTEFACT_REGISTER|REG-0001]].
6. Did not retire, delete or modify any AIEMS History or Full Chat artefact.
7. Created [[ESR-0014A_POST_CLOSURE_ENGINEERING_ADDENDUM|ESR-0014A]] as a post-closure addendum, preserving [[ESR-0014_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0014]] and [[RBL-0010_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0010]] without reopening them.

---

# 20. ESR-0015 Outcomes

1. Established the Sentinel execution pipeline in full: `sentinel/audit.py` (AuditRecorder infrastructure), `sentinel/policy.py` (PolicyEngine abstraction), `sentinel/openai_provider.py` (first external provider adapter), `jarvis/interfaces/sentinel_conversation.py` (Guardian/Sentinel integration).
2. Completed [[PEM-001_AI_PROVIDER_EVALUATION_MATRIX|PEM-001]] provider scoring; approved Primary OpenAI, Secondary Gemini, reasoning/coding comparison Anthropic, Gateway OpenRouter (experimentation only), local fallback Ollama.
3. Demonstrated the first live, policy-gated, audited Guardian conversation against a real external AI provider, run by the Programme Sponsor.
4. Grew test coverage from 105 to 133 passing tests with zero regressions.
5. Ran under the [[EE-0001_INDEPENDENT_AI_PEER_REVIEW_TRIAL|EE-0001]] Lead/Reviewer trial (Claude Lead, ChatGPT Reviewer); 10 Reviewer findings raised, 10 accepted.
6. Recommended and drafted [[RBL-0011_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0011]]; the Programme Sponsor accepted it on 8 July 2026, superseding [[RBL-0010_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0010]].
7. Created [[ESR-0015_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0015]] as the formal session closure report, including an Engineering Implementer draft of the EE-0001 trial scorecard pending independent Reviewer scoring.

---

# 21. ESR-0016 Outcomes

1. Established the Sentinel trust-tier policy model: `TrustTier` (routine/sensitive/restricted), `TrustCategory` (five categories), `TrustTierPolicy` implementing the existing `PolicyEngine` seam, with `SimpleApprovalPolicy` retained as the unchanged production default.
2. Corrected a classification-precedence defect found in review (deny-worthy categories could be softened to human review by also setting approval-required) before merge, with a permanent regression test.
3. Updated [[CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE|CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md]] (WP2A) and [[SAM-0001_SENTINEL_TRUST_ARCHITECTURE|SAM-0001]] (WP2B) to reflect the implemented model, following an Engineering Reviewer redirect of the original EIP (which had targeted SAM-0001 alone) to preserve SAM-0001's architecture-only scope.
4. Identified and corrected one genuine scope non-conformance: an unapproved substitute governance artefact created during WP2, including a self-exempting review-avoidance rule proposal - detected by the Engineering Reviewer, removed by the Engineering Lead, and the proposed rule explicitly rejected by the Programme Sponsor.
5. Ran under the [[EE-0001_INDEPENDENT_AI_PEER_REVIEW_TRIAL|EE-0001]] Lead/Reviewer trial with the rotation reversed from ESR-0015 (ChatGPT Lead, Claude Reviewer); reconciled scorecard shows both sides independently assessing Sponsor arbitration required as High, against ESR-0015's Low.
6. Added a dated EE-0001 Section 8 entry clarifying the "findings" metric's scope (submitted-work defects only), recomputing ESR-0016 to 7 findings / average discovery weight 3.0; confirmed ESR-0015's existing figures required no correction.
7. Retained [[RBL-0011_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0011]] as the current accepted repository baseline; ESR-0016's changes judged incremental, not warranting a new baseline.
8. Grew test coverage from 133 to 144 passing tests with zero regressions.
9. Created [[ESR-0016_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0016]] as the formal session closure report.

---

# 22. Session Start Guidance

At the start of the next separately approved engineering session or approved implementation activity, follow [[GDE-0001_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP|GDE-0001]] knowledge tiering:

1. Review README.md for repository orientation and platform context.
2. Review [[RBL-0011_REPOSITORY_BASELINE|RBL-0011]], the repository baseline the Programme Sponsor has retained as current.
3. Review [[PST-0001_PROGRAMME_STATUS|PST-0001]] (Current State tier).
4. Review the Architecture tier as referenced by PST-0001.
5. Review Active Standards (STD-0001 through STD-0004) where the session's work touches artefact creation or modification.
6. Review [[ESR-0016_ENGINEERING_SESSION_REPORT|ESR-0016]] (Current ESR tier).
7. Review [[REG-0001_CONTROLLED_ARTEFACT_REGISTER|REG-0001]].
8. Review [[PBK-0001_AI_ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK|PBK-0001]].
9. Review [[COC-0001_HUMAN_AI_COLLABORATION_CONTEXT|COC-0001]].
10. Review [[EE-0001_INDEPENDENT_AI_PEER_REVIEW_TRIAL|EE-0001]] to confirm current Lead/Reviewer rotation before beginning work - ESR-0017 is the designated Cold Start Validation Session (Claude leads, fresh conversation, repository-only onboarding per EE-0001 Section 3.4).
11. Search the Historical Archive (AIEMS History and Full Chat artefacts) only where deeper context is required.
12. Confirm Programme Sponsor approval before creating any future Engineering Session Report, future repository baseline or future engineering objective.

This guidance records the ESR-0016 closed state. PST-0001 does not create ESR-0017, accept a repository baseline or approve implementation outside separately authorised engineering work.

---

# 23. Maintenance

[[PST-0001_PROGRAMME_STATUS|PST-0001]] shall be reviewed and updated:

- at phase closure;
- when the active engineering phase changes;
- when the next planned engineering activity changes materially;
- when the capability roadmap changes;
- when a major baseline is accepted;
- when the Programme Sponsor directs an update.

PST-0001 should remain concise and must not duplicate detailed controlled artefacts.
